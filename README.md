# DiffEq
A python class that takes a differential equation in string in Lagrange notation and converts it into a sympy expression

Guidelines for entering a differential equation:
  Use double quotes, Lagrange notation uses single quotes for derivatives
  For multiplication use an asterisk
  For subtraction use +-, as in 5+-3. (There is a mathematical reason why this is more correct than 5-3, but that's beside the point)
The above guidelines are also listed in the documentation.
